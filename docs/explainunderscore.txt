  //underscore explanation for _.template: Compiles JavaScript templates into functions that can be evaluated for rendering. Useful for rendering complicated bits of HTML from JSON data sources. Template functions can both interpolate variables, using <%= … %>, as well as execute arbitrary JavaScript code, with <% … %>. If you wish to interpolate a value, and have it be HTML-escaped, use <%- … %> When you evaluate a template function, pass in a data object that has properties corresponding to the template's free variables. If you're writing a one-off, you can pass the data object as the second parameter to template in order to render immediately instead of returning a template function. The settings argument should be a hash containing any _.templateSettings that should be overridden.
